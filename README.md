# CV_Projects
This Repo is based on Computer Vision Projects. Using of Cameras and Vision devices with programming to make it useful for the people of the world.


This project aims for program to use and utilise the ablity of Computer vision with AI and ML algorithms to innovate new techonology. 

## Steps for Contribution:-

1. User should create a seperate folder named with thier project and it should contain main program file named `main.py` and other data files accordingly.

2. Program should be executable with any system, if specific versions required then mention in the file.

3. For installation of modules, create a `requirement.txt` file with modules and its versions

4. If program execute properly on our tests, then PR will be accepted.

**This steps must be followed to have a Acceptable PR.

## Features to the Users:-
This project could contribute and plan future roadmap for advancement in field of Computer Vision technology.

- CV technology can mainly contribute in aspect of Security. 

- It can also used for Machine learning based on CV interacting with real life factors and to analyse for data recognition.

All contributors are gratefully welcomed ✨

### Note:
1.Fake PR will not be accepted and Invalid based on activity will be marked as `invalid``.

2. We may ask to update/change the program if it includes bugs, will be markd as `bugs`
